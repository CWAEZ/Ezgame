# Security Policy for uYouPlus Developers
If I verify a reported security vulnerability, my policy is:

- the uYouPlusExtra Developer will patch the current main branch, as well as the immediate prior minor release branch.

- the Contributors are allowed to patch the current main branch with custom features and the ability to add new & updated Localizable Strings.

- After fully patching the main branch, the uYouPlusExtra Developer will issue a new release for the main branch along with LTS release branches.

## Supported Versions
